   # Verify token is set
   grep BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN .env.local
   ```

   - Max 10 files total

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)

### Files Upload But Links Don't Work

   - Files should be set to `public` access
   - Verify in Vercel dashboard

   - Should be publicly accessible
