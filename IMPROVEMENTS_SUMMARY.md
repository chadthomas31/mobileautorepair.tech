## Chatbot Evaluation & Recommendation

### Current Implementation
The AI voice assistant (ConvAI) has been **retained and optimized** with the following improvements:

1. **Better Positioning:** Moved to a dedicated section after educational content, not competing with primary CTAs
2. **Enhanced Context:** Added "Ask me about" prompts to guide users
3. **Clear Value:** Positioned as 24/7 availability for common questions
4. **Mobile Optimization:** Simplified visual indicator for better mobile performance

### Recommendation: **Keep the Chatbot** ✅

**Reasons:**
- **Differentiator:** Few competitor mobile mechanic sites use AI chat, making this a unique feature
- **After-Hours Support:** Provides value when phone lines are closed
- **Lead Capture:** Can collect service details and schedule appointments
- **User Choice:** Doesn't interfere with traditional contact methods (phone, form)

**Conditions:**
- ✅ Must work reliably across all devices (especially iPhone, as noted in your research)
- ✅ Should not block essential content or CTAs (now resolved with new placement)
- ✅ Needs to provide genuine value by answering FAQs accurately

**Alternative if Issues Persist:**
If the chatbot continues to have technical problems or low engagement, consider replacing it with:
- A simple live chat widget (e.g., Intercom, Drift)
- An FAQ accordion section
- Removing it entirely in favor of the prominent phone number and booking form
